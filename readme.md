# React + Firebase ToDo App


![logo](readme_img/2022-08-06-00-46-23.png)
## Let's get started in here:
First create a Firebase app, name it whatever you want.  
Then run this: 
` npm install -g firebase-tools`  
Then you probably need to `firebase login`  
And then `firebase init`  
There is now a scrolling list in your CLI, select *`Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files`*  
Language: `JavaScript`  
Eslint: `No`  
Install dependencies: `Yes`

Paste this into `functions/index.js`:
```js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');

exports.helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
     response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
```  
Then: `firebase deploy`  
At this point, Google may bug you to switch from their *Spark* account to their *Blaze* account. It's pay as you go.

Once that's done, go to the project in your browser. Click **Build** on the left side of the screen, then click **Functions** and mouseover the function to copy the URL. You can also look in your CLI right near where it says **Deploy complete!**, there is a line just above it with a clickable Function URL.  
*Congrats, you just created something in Firebase!*

## Next part: Installing Express
`npm i express`

Now create some folders and files  
 `mkdir functions/apis`  
 `touch functions/apis/todos.js`

Remove everything from the `index.js` and then copy-paste the following code:

```js
//index.js

const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const app = require('express')();

const {
    getAllTodos
} = require('./apis/todos') // make sure this matches the case of the dir name!

app.get('/todos', getAllTodos);
exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app);
```
Now we have a route. When a user hits the `/todos` route, it will execute the `getAllTodos` function, which we will now write into the `todos.js` file in `functions/apis/`  
```js
//todos.js

exports.getAllTodos = (req, res) => {
    todos = [
        {
            'id': '1',
            'title': 'greeting',
            'body': 'Hello world from sharvin shah' 
        },
        {
            'id': '2',
            'title': 'greeting2',
            'body': 'Hello2 world2 from sharvin shah' 
        }
    ]
    return res.json(todos);
}
```
Now you `firebase deploy`  and press `y` when the `helloWorld` prompt to `Would you like to proceed with deletion?` comes up.

## Oh Noes! An Error

```
Error: There was an error deploying functions
```

This is not very helpful. What went wrong... hmmm. I went back through the code, and noticed this first (to be clear, this is *not* the error)
```js
const app = require('express')(); //this is not the error.
```
What's with those trailing `()`'s? I don't remember seeing that before when working with MERN apps. He's... invoking it as he requires it? I don't get it. This is something to explore more later.

Anyway, before long I found the culprit. In the original tutorial, the `apis` folder is `APIs`. This case sensitivity was the problem. My folder is called
```
react-firebase-todo/functions/apis
```
but the `require` in `index.js` is...
```js
require('./APIs/todos')
```
They don't match. I changed it to:
```js
require('./apis/todos')
```
Seved, and tried 'firebase deploy' again, and got my happy little **âœ”  Deploy complete!**

At this point, I tried to open the URL at `https://us-central1-thenameofmytodoapp.cloudfunctions.net/api/todos`
## Lets move on
